## [E.A. Seguy Sample Intro to Wax for NCSULA Cool Tools Presentation](https://ericayhayes.github.io/seguy)

The online exhibit was built using [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/#/wax/?id=top), an extensible workflow for producing scholarly exhibitions with minimal computing principles. Wax relies on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [IIIF](http://iiif.io/) level 0 compliance static files, [Leaflet IIIF](https://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/), [IIIF_S3](https://github.com/cmoa/iiif_s3), and is built upon the work developed by [Marii Nyr√∂p](http://marii.info/), [Peter Brinkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex). This is a sample site for NCSULA's Cool Tools event that showcases new tools to librarians.
