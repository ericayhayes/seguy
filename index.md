__E.A. Séguy__ was active as a designer and artist in France in the first three decades of the 20th century. Of that much I am confident. But there is strangely very little biographical material about him online. Much of what is around is copied from site to site (whether university or poster shop) and I don't think all of it is trustworthy. Part of the problem comes from the fact that there was another E.A. Séguy (Eugene Alain - names they both 'might' share too) active in Paris at the same time - but he was an entomologist, strangely enough. One of them died in 1989 so it's likely these prints remain under copyright.  THIS IS A TEST

In any event, Séguy the artist is best remembered for a couple of series of prints he produced in the 1920s - 'Papillons' and 'Insectes' - both of which are featured above. The wonderfully lush and vibrant colours we see come from the multiple-stencil technique of pochoir printing, usually associated with the Art Nouveau and Art Deco movements.

Séguy consulted textbooks in an effort to bring a scientific level of accuracy to his work and included the species names and geographic origins that I've copied in as captions. His other work - some 11 albums - abstract his natural history penchant into the world of decorative design in which he constructed decals and motifs from insects, crystals, wings and similar.

Last year North Carolina State University purchased 'Papillons' and we are fortunate indeed that they digitized both that and 'Insectes' - I knew about the large stash of Séguy work at NYPL but the quality and size of their images is mediocre at best. NCSU definitely have the best images online but unfortunately they are all obstructively caged inside the Luna Insight browser architecture. It's worth the trouble in my opinion: these prints are fantastic seen at high magnification, a testament both to the exceptional quality of the pochoir process and to Séguy's artistic abilities.
